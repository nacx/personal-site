I am a researcher in cloud computing, virtualization and container technologies, and open source community contributor. My research interests revolve around distributed and highly concurrent systems, large cloud infrastructures, networking and SDN, and security.

Currently working as the Security Lead at [Tetrate](https://tetrate.io) and building a Service Mesh platform for the
hybrid and multi-cloud world.

I am a Member of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org), where I help with community outreach and the promotion of Open Source and _The Apache Way_, and committer and member of the [Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org), Community Development, and [Apache jclouds](https://jclouds.apache.org) project management committees.
