### Do you need a service mesh?

_CodeMotion Madrid, 2018_

In this talk I explored what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservice web backends. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, weâ€™ll find out! This session also briefly covered how a service mesh works, giving us a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk.

### Rule the cloud with Apache jclouds

_ApacheCon North America, 2016_

Apache jclouds is an open source multi-cloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds while giving you full control to use cloud-specific features.

In this talk I explored the core concepts around jclouds and did a demo showing how the same code can be used to
manage your infrastructure in different cloud providers.
