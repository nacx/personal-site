### Next Generation Access Control for the Multi-Cloud World

_Service Mesh Day San Francisco, 2019_

NGAC is a fundamental reworking of traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of the modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. NGAC is based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide access control services for a number of different types of resources, accessed by a number of different types of applications and users.

In this joint talk with [David Ferraiolo](https://www.nist.gov/people/david-ferraiolo) from [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) we introduced NGAC and did a live demo showing how it can be applied to augment traditional RBAC with high level concepts such as time and location in an efficient and scalable way.

### Do you need a service mesh?

_CodeMotion Madrid, 2018 (Spanish)_

In this talk I explored what a service mesh is and what they can do for your microservice web backends. Are the claims of observability, resiliency, and WAF features real? Are they useful during development, production, or both? Using pictures and demos, weâ€™ll find out! This session also briefly covered how a service mesh works, giving us a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk.

### Standalone Neutron: How we integrated it with Abiquo

_OpenStack BCN 7th birthday meetup, 2017_

This is a talk I gave at the OpenStack BCN 7th birthday meetup. 
In it I explain how we integrated a standalone Neutron with Abiquo to implement an SDN solution without a full OpenStack deployment.

### Rule the cloud with Apache jclouds

_ApacheCon North America, 2016_

Apache jclouds is an open source multi-cloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds while giving you full control to use cloud-specific features.

In this talk I explored the core concepts around jclouds and did a demo showing how the same code can be used to
manage your infrastructure in different cloud providers.
