# Personal website

This is my personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Rendering the site

Make sure you have Hugo installed:

```bash
brew install hugo
```

Then you can build the site with:

```bash
make dev
```

Now open `https://localhost:1313` in your browser. Any changes you make to the website source will be immediately
reflected, and auto-reloaded, in your browser.

# Publish the site

The site can be easily published to GitHub pages as follows:

```bash
make publish
```
